A fully functional calculator to make/dilute solutions for biology/chemistry lab work. </br>

<h2> Do your lab calculations fast and convenient, and save the solution recipe! </h2>
</br>
Calculations for solution making from solide substances or by diluting a more concentrated (so-called "stock") solution are done everyday in biology and chemistry labs. Calculations are done manually or using some calculator website. 
This Java program has a user friendly GUI, can be used offline, and offers building complex solution recipes with multiple ingredients, which can be saved as a text file for further editing or print. 
The ranges of unit prefixes are chosen to accomodate the ranges occurring in real-life practice. In case an event is carried out successfully or an error occurs, the user is informed by a message box implemented in the GUI.

The code is fully open source and the executable file can be downloaded through this link for free.
